Lesson 6 – Creating Basic Visualizations & Interactivity
1. Name three types of visuals you can create in Power BI.

Bar chart

Line chart

Pie chart

2. How do you add a slicer to a report?

Click the Slicer visual in the Visualizations pane and drag a field into it.

3. What is the difference between a bar chart and a column chart?

Bar chart shows data horizontally

Column chart shows data vertically

4. How do you change the color of a visual background?

Select the visual → Format pane → Background → Color.

5. What does "drill-down" mean in a visual?

Drill-down lets users click on a data point to see more detailed levels of data.

7. Add a slicer for Quarter to filter all visuals on the page.

Add a Slicer

Drag Quarter into the slicer field

8. Format the bar chart to show data labels.

Select the chart → Format → Data labels → On.

9. Use a line chart to show SalesAmount trends over Quarter.

Select Line chart

Quarter → X-Axis

SalesAmount → Y-Axis

10. Add a tooltip to display Product details when hovering over bars.

Drag Product into the Tooltips field of the visual.

11. Sync slicers across multiple report pages.

Use View → Sync slicers, then select pages to sync.

12. Create a custom visual with dynamic measure selection (Sales vs. Profit).

Use Field Parameters to let users switch between measures dynamically.

13. Implement a hierarchy for Region > Product > Quarter drill-down.

Create a hierarchy by dragging:

Region

Product

Quarter
into one hierarchy field, then enable drill-down.

14. Use bookmarks to toggle between two visuals in the same space.

Create two bookmarks (one per visual) and add buttons linked to each bookmark.

15. Optimize a slow-rendering report with 10+ visuals.

Reduce the number of visuals per page

Use filters instead of extra visuals

Optimize the data model (star schema, fewer columns)
