Lesson 7 – Project 1: Basic Sales Dashboard
1. What is the purpose of the "Data/Model" view in Power BI?

Data view is used to inspect and validate table data.

Model view is used to create and manage relationships between tables.

2. Troubleshoot: Slicers not affecting all visuals — how to fix?

Check Edit interactions and ensure the slicer filters all visuals. Also confirm relationships are set correctly.
